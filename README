Getting started 

1. Change database settings in config/database.yml to your specifications. Source database is the database you want to migrate and the details are under bart. 

2. Run rake db:create RAILS_ENV=['environment for execution'] eg  rake db:create RAILS_ENV='development' to creat database to keep migrated data.

3. If database has been succesfully created, run rake db:migrate to create the tables and relations.

4. You can now run the migrator script in the script folder with script runner. ie script/runner script/migrator.rb
