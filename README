Migration-2.0

Getting started 

1. Change database settings in config/database.yml to your specifications.
   - under bart2: enter the details of your Source database. (This is the database you want to export from. The OpenMRS 1.1 dataset).
   - under development/production: enter the details of your destination database. For the sake of constistency the database name should be bart1_intermediate_bare_bones.

2. Run rake db:create RAILS_ENV=['environment for execution'] eg  rake db:create RAILS_ENV='development' to create database to keep the exported data. This is the database which will hold 12/14 flat tables.

3. If database has been succesfully created, run rake db:migrate to create the tables and relations.

4. You can now run the migrator script in the script folder with script runner. ie script/runner script/migrator.rb
